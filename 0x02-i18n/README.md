# This project covers some concepts on i18n:
- How to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
- How to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user   
    settings or request headers
- How to localize timestamps


# Tasks

### [0. Basic Flask app](./0-app.py)
* First you will setup a basic Flask app in `0-app.py`. Create a single `/` route and an `index.html` template that simply outputs “Welcome to my Holberton” as page title (`<title>`) and “Hello world” as header (`<h1>`).
